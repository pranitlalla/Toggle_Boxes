# Toggle Boxes React Project

This project demonstrates a grid of toggleable boxes using React.

## Components

### Box

The `Box` component represents an individual box in the grid. It receives two props:

- `isActive` (boolean): Indicates whether the box is active or not.
- `toggleBox` (function): Toggles the active state of the box when clicked.

Example usage:
```jsx
import Box from "./Box.jsx"

<Box isActive={true} toggleBox={() => {}} />
```

### BoxGrid

The `BoxGrid` component represents the grid of boxes. It manages the state of the boxes using the `useState` hook. It provides a `reset` function to reset the state of the boxes and a `toggleBox` function to toggle the active state of a specific box.

Example usage:
```jsx
import BoxGrid from "./BoxGrid.jsx"

<BoxGrid />
```

## Styling

The styling for the boxes is defined in the `Box.css` and `BoxGrid.css` files.

### Box.css

```css
.Box {
  justify-content: center;
  width: 150px;
  height: 150px;
  margin: 10px;
  display: inline-block;
}
```

### BoxGrid.css

The `BoxGrid.css` file contains styling specific to the box grid component.
